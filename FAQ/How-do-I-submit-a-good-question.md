Many of the questions asked on the Snort list contain very poor or incomplete information, so this is a guide on how to ask a good question:

*	Explain the problem you are having. What, exactly, are you are trying to accomplish?
* Paste the output of 'snort -V' (without the quotes).
*	Paste the entire command line you are using to start Snort.
*	Paste any output you receive (an error, a crash, any verbiage that's on the screen.)	
* Paste your snort.conf file at the very end of the email.

This will help us get started helping you figure out your problem so you can solve it.
